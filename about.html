									<p> Lei and Cristine  has been great to work with.   As a local remodeling contractor specializing in kitchens and bathrooms, we often require the advise and guidance of an Architect.  Many of our projects are small, but very detailed, and Mj is always there when we need him.  His plans help to get Permits in a timely manner and allow us to keep the job running.  Together we are able to produce incredible projects.  Working with Zach has been a pleasure, and I would highly recommend Monteprima Designs.</p>

									<p> I loved working with Monteprima Architects . My wife and I were exploring a basement remodel and wanted to get an in-home design consultation to discuss options and limitations. I was truly impressed by Monteprima Architect's wisdom and their knowledge on the matter. They provided wonderful advice and feedback on our initial ideas and also provided a simple and straightforward proposal to build out the design. Mack was thorough and detail-oriented. I highly recommend Monteprima Designs as a solution for architectural design and consultation.</p>
