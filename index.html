									<br>
									<!--<small class="project-subtitle">irure dolor voluptate</small>-->
									<p>The process of planning, designing, and constructing residential, non-commercial, and living spaces is known as residential architecture. Residential architecture includes town homes, mansions, apartment complexes, and everything in between. It might be current or nostalgic. Urban or rural. Simple or unusual. Residential design is all about capturing the needs and desires of the homeowner and transforming these often mysterious concepts into a tangible house. Our team is comprised of experts who specializes and excel in the development, planning and design of Housing Units. In a sense this harmonizes by creating the ideal home for each and every individual.</p>

										<!--<small class="project-subtitle">irure dolor voluptate</small>-->
									<p>The emphasis of interior architecture is on the interior and its suitability for human habitation. Interior architecture is the art and science of designing, restoring, or updating the interiors of various structures, such as homes, offices, and other interior spaces. This type of architecture also includes the conversion of one area into another. Interior architects are typically involved in the creation or reconstruction of interior settings, usually changing the home's structure. They must consider building construction and building codes to develop a safe and habitable living place. The team has an ideal goal of composing the conditions placed by the client as well the restrictions of both reality and law to create the ideal goal that will serve the purpose of the room.</p>

												<p> Lei and Cristine  has been great to work with.   As a local remodeling contractor specializing in kitchens and bathrooms, we often require the advise and guidance of an Architect.  Many of our projects are small, but very detailed, and Mj is always there when we need him.  His plans help to get Permits in a timely manner and allow us to keep the job running.  Together we are able to produce incredible projects.  Working with Zach has been a pleasure, and I would highly recommend Monteprima Designs.</p>

												<p>Architects . My wife and I were exploring a basement remodel and wanted to get an in-home design consultation to discuss options and limitations. I was truly impressed by Monteprima Architect's wisdom and their knowledge on the matter. They provided wonderful advice and feedback on our initial ideas and also provided a simple and straightforward proposal to build out the design. Mack was thorough and detail-oriented. I highly recommend Monteprima Designs as a solution for architectural design and consultation.</p>
